                    <h5>Co-Owner | Certified Personal Trainer & Nutrition Coach</h5>
                    <p>For the past 7 years, taking care of my body—both physically and nutritionally—has been my passion and my purpose. Through my own journey, I've explored and coached a wide variety of fitness formats including weightlifting, barre, Pilates, yoga, cardio, and dance-based workouts, all through an at-home training platform.</p>

                    <p>Alongside movement, I've become deeply invested in nutrition—specifically macro tracking. I've learned how to properly fuel my body through every phase: deficit, maintenance, and now a bulk. That experience opened my eyes to how many others are looking for the tools and support to do the same.</p>

                    <p>As a Certified Personal Trainer and Certified Nutrition Coach, I now offer both in-person training and online coaching. I'm passionate about helping others feel strong, confident, and in control of their health—and I'd be honored to walk alongside you on your journey.</p>

                    <h2>Meet Janae</h2>
                    <h5>Co-Owner | Certified Personal Trainer & Nutrition Coach</h5>
                    <p>I graduated in May 2025 with my Bachelor's in Exercise Science from Carson-Newman University. During the summer of 2024, I interned at a local gym where I taught group fitness classes and led personal training sessions. That experience—along with my own wellness journey—inspired me to start coaching. I'm now a Certified Personal Trainer and Certified Nutrition Coach, with additional certifications in CPR/AED, Virtual Coaching, Business Basics, and Home Gym Design. I'm passionate about helping others feel strong, confident, and capable by optimizing their health through fitness and nutrition. I'd love to be a part of your journey!</p>
